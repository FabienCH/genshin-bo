To do that, add a swsResize filter and set Width to\r\n        1920 and Height to 1080.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Finally, add a Crop filter. You have to set values around 1294 for left, 137 for right and 121 for top and bottom. The most\r\n        important is to have a size of 488 x 838. In my case the video I used had a resolution of 2560 x 1440 so I had to set 1294 - 138 -\r\n        122 - 120.
