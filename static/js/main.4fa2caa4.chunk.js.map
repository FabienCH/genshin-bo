We'll see how to do it with\r\n        Avidemux to feel free to use any other video editor if you want.\r\n        <br />\r\n        First, you have to open your video and set Video Output to Mpeg4 AVC (x264) and Output Format to MP4 Muxer.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img className={classes.img} src={avidemux} alt=\"avidemux\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        Now, under Video Output, click on Configure and set Encoding mode to Constant Bitrate and Target Bitrate to 2500.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Then click on Filter and start by adding a Resample FPS filter and set it to 10 FPS (setting a low FPS value will shorten artifacts\r\n        import duration).\r\n        <br />\r\n        If your TV resolution is higher than 1920 x 1080 you have to resize the video. To do that, add a swsResize filter and set Width to\r\n        1920 and Height to 1080.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Finally, add a Crop filter. You have to set values around 1294 for left, 137 for right and 121 for top and bottom. The most\r\n        important is to have a size of 488 x 838. In my case the video I used had a resolution of 2560 x 1440 so I had to set 1294 - 138 -\r\n        122 - 120.
