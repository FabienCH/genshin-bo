To do that, add a swsResize filter and set Width to\r\n        1920 and Height to 1080.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Finally, add a Crop filter. You have to set values around 1294 for left, 137 for right and 121 for top and bottom. The most\r\n        important is to have a size of 488 x 838. In my case the video I used had a resolution of 2560 x 1440 so I had to set 1294 - 138 -\r\n        122 - 120. In the end, you should have something like this.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img className={classes.img} src={avidemuxFilters} alt=\"avidemux-filters\" />\r\n      <p>You're done, close the filter window and click on the floppy disk to export the video.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(styles)(Ps4ImportGuide);\r\n","import { Fragment, ReactElement } from 'react';\r\nimport { createStyles, withStyles, WithStyles } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport { Theme } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport ImportGuideTable, { Row } from './import-guide-table';\r\nimport DialogContainer from '../../shared/dialog-container';\r\nimport Accordion from '@material-ui/core/Accordion';\r\nimport AccordionDetails from '@material-ui/core/AccordionDetails';\r\nimport AccordionSummary from '@material-ui/core/AccordionSummary';\r\nimport ExpandMoreIcon from '@material-ui/icons/ExpandMore';\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport PcImportGuide from './pc-import-guide';\r\nimport Ps4ImportGuide from './ps4-import-guide';\r\n\r\nconst styles = ({ palette }: Theme) =>\r\n  createStyles({\r\n    link: {\r\n      color: palette.primary.main,\r\n      textDecoration: 'none',\r\n    },\r\n    accordionsContainer: {\r\n      marginTop: 20,\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n\r\ninterface ImportGuideProps extends WithStyles<typeof styles> {\r\n  onClose: () => void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction ImportGuide(props: ImportGuideProps): ReactElement {\r\n  const { classes } = props;\r\n\r\n  const [expanded, setExpanded] = React.useState<'pc-panel' | 'ps4-panel' | false>(false);\r\n\r\n  const handleAccordionChange = (panel: 'pc-panel' | 'ps4-panel') => (_: React.ChangeEvent<unknown>, isExpanded: boolean) => {\r\n    setExpanded(isExpanded ? panel : false);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleClose = (): void => {\r\n    props.onClose();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const performanceHeaderRows: Row[] = [\r\n    [{ value: 'Nb of Artifacts' }, { value: 'Duration for each CPU and threads', colSpan: 3 }],\r\n    [{ value: '' }, { value: 'i5-6500 – 3 threads' }, { value: 'i5-8250U – 7 threads' }, { value: 'i3-6100U – 3 threads' }],\r\n  ];\r\n  const chromeRows: Row[] = [\r\n    [{ value: 210 }, { value: '6m42 (avg of 5)' }, { value: '8m31 (avg of 5)' }, { value: '17m26 (avg of 3)' }],\r\n    [{ value: 630 }, { value: '20m56 (avg of 3)' }, { value: '29m33 (avg of 3)' }, { value: '50m38 (1)' }],\r\n  ];\r\n  const firefoxRows: Row[] = [\r\n    [{ value: 210 }, { value: '7m51 (avg of 5)' }, { value: '12m50 (avg of 5)' }, { value: '18m39 (avg of 3)' }],\r\n    [{ value: 630 }, { value: '23m03 (avg of 3)' }, { value: '35m43 (avg of 3)' }, { value: '53m53 (1)' }],\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <DialogContainer title=\"Artifacts Import Guide\" onClose={handleClose}>\r\n      <Fragment>\r\n        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            [PC] Download and install OBS Studio:{' '}\r\n            <a className={classes.link} href=\"https://obsproject.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\r\n              https://obsproject.com/download\r\n            </a>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            [PS4] Download and install Avidemux (or any other video editor you may be already familiar with):{' '}\r\n            <a className={classes.link} href=\"http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/download.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\r\n              http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/download\r\n            </a>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>Set Genshin Impact language to English</li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            If you want to import more than 500 artifacts from 1 video, you need at least 2.5Go of free RAM.
